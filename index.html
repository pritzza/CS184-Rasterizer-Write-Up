    <h1>Homework 1: Rasterizer</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>

            In our study of computer graphics, we explore the topic of rasterization. We delve into how we can draw
            or rasteraize a triangle. We explored supersampling for
            antialiasing, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing visual smoothness. Our creative abilities were
            tested as we implemented select 2D linear transformations and tested them out on a cubeman. 
            We also investigated barycentric coordinates for color blending, texture sampling, and  more.
            Comparing pixel sampling methods for texture mapping, we identified the antialiasing superiority of
            bilinear sampling over nearest neighbor sampling. Lastly, we analyzed all our sampling techniques to evaluate
            the performance trade offs with the results of each method. This project not only advanced our 
            technical skills but also our capacity to apply rendering strategies for improved visual outcomes.

        <h2>Section I: Rasterization</h2>

        <h3>Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>
        <p>
            Triangle rasterization is fundamental part of the GPU rendering pipeline. In our rasterizer, the computation
            is performed by establishing the AABB (axis aligned bounding box) of the triangle and iterating through each
            pixel in the area. For the coordinate of each pixel we compute whether that point lies within the triangle.
            This is done evaluating the orientation of the coordinate with respect to each edge of the triangle. We
            ensure that the ability to rasterize a triangle is independent of its winding order by verifying our point
            is oriented left or right of every edge.
        </p>

        <h3>Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>
        <p>

            Supersampling is a means of increasing the sample rate of a signal. Doing this to a high frequency signal
            helps mitigate aliasing. When we are trying to rasterize very small or narrow triangles, or sampling a
            texture with a very high frequency relative to our sample rate, aliasing artifacts manifest. To implement
            supersampling we sampled across a uniform N*N grid inside of each pixel in the framebuffer. We maintain a
            sample buffer with dimensions W*N, H*N (where W and H are the framebuffer’s width and height respectively)
            and populate it with sample data before downsampling to the dimensions of the framebuffer. The process of
            downsampling is that of taking the average color of every sample in the grid corresponding to a pixel.
            Resizing the frame and sample buffer with the resizing of the window, as well as downscaling the sample
            buffer to fit the framebuffer after rasterizing all the geometry was vital to implementing supersampling.
            Finally, with supersampling implemented, the evil jaggies be gone!

        </div>

        <p>
            Here we see our enemy the jaggies! A very high frequency signal which with our comparatively low sample rate
            gives the notion that the top piece of the triangle is disconnected from the base. However as we increase
            the
            sample rate, we approach a better representation of the area the triangle really occupies.

        <h3>Part 3: Transforms</h3>
        <p>
            Our little cubeman thickened up his arms and legs a little bit and struck a pose! We have transformed his
            components, including rotating his head and lower arms, non-uniformly scaling both his upper and lower arms
            and legs, and translated his lower arms to have him strike a pose

        <h2>Section II: Sampling</h2>

        <h3>Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
        <div class="img-with-text">
          <img src="images/image9.png" />
        </div>        
        <p>

            The prefix “bary-” means weight or pressure. A way to understand barycentric coordinates is as a means of
            representing a point as the weighted sum or two or more points. Particularly intuitive about their
            definition is that the weighted sum totals to 1 so each coordinate of a barycentric coordinate system can be
            thought of as the percent weight or contribution of a point. In the rendering above, you can attribute the
            colors, red, green, and blue to the bottom, top-left, and top-right of the triangle respectively. Notice how
            closer to the vertex, the greater its weight and thus the closer the fragment is to the color of its nearest
            vertex.

        </div>
        <h3>Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>
        <p>
            Texture mapping was achieved using barycentric interpolation between the texture coordinates defined for
            each vertex of a triangle. Having a uv or texture coordinate on the surface of a triangle, we can sample a
            texture map and color the corresponding pixel with the texel that we sample. Because our texture maps are
            also just discrete data which we sample, we can use all of our signal processing ideas. When sampling a
            texture, we can decide whether we want to use the texel which the sample point lands closest to, or do a
            bilinear interpolation of the surrounding texels of our sample point. Bilinear interpolation helps with
            antialiasing as it can smoothen out the signal, but requires more computation than the simple look up
            required for nearest neighbor sampling.

        <p>
            We can notice some subtle differences in the images. It can be seen that supersampling and bilinear
            interpolation both enhance antialiasing. By how bilinear filtering works, smoothing the transition between
            texels, its effect becomes very noticeable when applied to lower resolution texture data. Suppose you have a
            2x2
            texture image. When doing nearest neighbor pixel sampling, you will only see up to 4 distinct colors
            (provided
            no supersampling), but with bilinear interpolation, samples will take from a gradient of color between
            distinct
            colors.
        </p>

        <h3>Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
        <p>

            Level sampling is a clever technique for antialiasing texture sampling. It operates to mitigate the issue of
            when a small difference in screen space coordinates results in a large change in texture coordinate. It
            works by generating a series of texture maps with an increased amount of high frequencies filtered out.
            Then, by dynamically selecting the filtered texture best matching the sample rate of the texture, we can
            achieve some nice antialiased texture sampling. We implement level sampling as described in Williams 1983.
            For each texture we generate a series of mipmaps and for every texel we need to sample, we compute what a
            small difference on screen space coordinate will change the texture coordinate we’re sampling and the
            correct mipmap level. We offer multiple options for how the mipmap is chosen for further antialiasing. The
            option of sampling form the nearest mipmap level is present, as well as the option to linearly interpolate
            between the two closest mipmap levels.

            <br></br>

            Our rasterizer now supports many sampling techniques which can be used in conjunction with each other,
            including pixel sampling, level sampling, and super sampling. Taking an analysis of the benefits and
            limitations of each technique will provide us insight into which to use and how to get the results we want.
            Super sampling in our implementation has a quadratic cost in both memory and runtime. Though smarter
            implementations may be done at almost no memory cost. Supersampling offers the most detailed antialiasing as
            it increases the number of samples we take. Level sampling on the other hand comes as a legible cost of
            linear memory per mipmapped texture. Creating mipmaps takes linear time but can be precomputed and reused.
            Sampling with mipmaps takes a small and constant number of operations. It yields textures being filtered of
            their high frequencies resulting in nice antialiasing. Finally pixel sampling, essentially no memory cost
            and minimal runtime costs offers a very primitive yet reasonably effective antialiasing effect as it gives
            linearly interpolated transitions between signals.
